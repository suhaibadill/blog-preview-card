## 🛠 My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (Variables)
- **Flexbox** (Nested layouts)
- **Fluid Typography** (CSS `clamp()` function)
- Responsive design without Media Queries

---

## 🚀 What I Learned

- How to create **Fluid Typography** using `clamp()` to make text responsive.
- Implementing **Neo-brutalism** design with sharp `box-shadow`.
- Organizing content using **Nested Flexbox** for better spacing control.
- Controlling card responsiveness using `max-width` instead of fixed widths.

---

## 🤖 AI Collaboration

- Used **Gemini (AI)** to understand fluid typography and debug Git conflicts.
- Refined the CSS layout and learned best practices for responsive components.
